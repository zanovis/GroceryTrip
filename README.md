# GroceryTrip
GroceryTrip helps you make more sense of your groceries

GroceryTrip is an Android app (iOS coming soon) that helps you gain insight into the overall nutrition, ingredients, and packaging of your groceries. Scan receipts to unlock detailed product info, and contribute to an ever-growing database!

## üåü Features
- Supports: Trader Joe's receipts (limited), barcode-based receipts (limited)
- Scan receipts for grocery details
- View compiled nutrition facts, ingredients, and packaging info
- Submit unrecognized barcodes

## üöÄ Getting Started
1. Take a photo of your grocery store receipt
2. Crop the image to capture just the product names OR barcodes (not both)
3. Discover overall nutrition, ingredients, and packaging used in your grocery trip
4. *Optional:* contribute barcodes!

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: GroceryTrip is in development and is not production-ready. We are working to support more stores and receipt types.

## ü§ù Contributing
As the project is not yet open-source, contributions are currently limited to barcode submissions. To contribute, simply use the app to submit any unrecognized barcodes. This will help improve the overall functionality of the app.

Once the project becomes open-source and implements proper authentication, code contributions will be welcomed!

## üìã Todo
- Create roadmap
- Support more stores (open to suggestions) and receipt types 
- Implement proper authentication 
- Open-source project
- iOS support
