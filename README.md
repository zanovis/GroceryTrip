## 🌟 Features

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Take a photo of your grocery store receipt
2. Crop the image to capture just the product names OR barcodes (not both)
3. Discover overall nutrition, ingredients, and packaging used in your grocery trip
4. *Optional:* contribute barcodes!

⚠️ Note: GroceryTrip is in development and is not production-ready. We are working to support more stores and receipt types.

## 🤝 Contributing
As the project is not yet open-source, contributions are currently limited to barcode submissions. To contribute, simply use the app to submit any unrecognized barcodes. This will help improve the overall functionality of the app.

Once the project becomes open-source and implements proper authentication, code contributions will be welcomed!
