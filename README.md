# GroceryTrip
### Turn receipts into nutritional information. 

GroceryTrip is a Flutter app that helps you view the overall nutrition & ingredients of your groceries more comprehensively. Scan receipts to see overall and detailed product info, and contribute to a growing database!

**You can use the app [Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium) to keep GroceryTrip up to date.*

## üåü Features
- Supports: Trader Joe's receipts, barcode-based receipts (limited)
- Scan receipts for product details
- View compiled nutrition facts
- View ingredients
- Submit unrecognized barcodes
- If product data is missing, you can click a product to contribute to the [OpenFoodFacts](https://github.com/openfoodfacts) database (Directs to the OFF application if you have it installed) 

## üöÄ How it works
1. Take a photo of your grocery store receipt (if you don't have one on-hand, you can use the Demo button!) - _This photo remains local on your device, and does not get uploaded._
3. Crop the image to capture relevant information - _Optical Character Recognition is performed on the cropped image to extract the text, and a database is searched to find each item on the receipt, if the receipt contains a string. Once a match is found (or the receipt contains barcodes), the barcode is searched within the OpenFoodFacts database (nothing is uploaded in this step)._
4. View overall nutrition & ingredients in your groceries
5. Optionally contribute barcodes if any are missing, your grocery list and results will automatically update once a barcode has been submitted for a receipt. - _You can choose to upload barcodes to the Firebase database to improve future results. An account is required to submit barcodes._

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: GroceryTrip is a work in progress and there are many improvements to be made!

## ü§ù Contributing
